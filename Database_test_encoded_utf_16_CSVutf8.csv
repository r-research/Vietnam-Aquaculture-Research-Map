October,2014,? Could be Feb,2015,Adaptation of Rice-Shrimp Farming in the Mekong Delta: How community adaptation solutions can inform landscape level change,"USAID, Mekong ARCC, ADMI, VNRC","The project implemented pilot rice-shrimp farming adaptation strategies in 2014-15 within Thuan Hoa, directly involving 32 farmers working 54 ha of land. Concurrently, USAID Mekong ARCC and partner AMDI sought to demonstrate the initiative to the Vietnam Government, and subsequently responded to their request to conduct a comprehensive review of rice-shrimp farming practices extending across five delta provinces",Adaptation initivatives,"Salt-tolerant rice and sedge grass species; shrimp nursery and improved post larvae selection training, Standard Operating Procedures handbooks developed and given",Research,,An Minh ,Kiên Giang,Thuận Hòa,Report on computer,Secondary source: https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00M3XG.pdf
,,,,,,"As a result, aspects of the initial communitybased adaptation pilot project implemented in Thuan Hoa through USAID Mekong ARCC will expand out from the trial area of 54 ha across five delta provinces influencing upwards of 250,000 ha of rice-shrimp farming production; potentially benefitting over one million people who rely on this system for their income.",,,,,,Kiên Giang,,,
