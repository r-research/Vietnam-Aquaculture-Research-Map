# Vietnam-Aquaculture-Research-Map
This is an interactive map of rice-shrimp aquaculture research projects happening in the Vietnam Mekong Delta

Vietnam_Map_folium.ipynb contains the code needed to generate the maps with a database of locations

Vietnam_Map_folium_improvements.ipynb contains the code needed to generate the maps with a database of locations. The markers have tables of information and clickable links. These currently lead to downloading of PDF's since all the sources are papers in PDF form. 

Python packages needed:
geoplot and geoplot.crs
geopandas
pandas
import pathlib
matplotlib.pyplot
mapclassify
numpy
folium

You can view the interactive map in the link below as Github does not display the folium maps: https://nbviewer.org/github/r-research/Vietnam-Aquaculture-Research-Map/blob/main/Mapping_Vietnam_folium.ipynb
